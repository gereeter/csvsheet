# csvsheet

A (*very* WIP) program for editing and viewing CSV files. Currently, only viewing really works (editing works but save doesn't because I didn't want to accidentally corrupt data). Also, currently `|` is hardcoded as the record separator instead of `,` because the files I've been working on are like that.

Although it is very WIP, it has enough implemented (search, hiding columns, navigation) that I use it to manage my contacts list.
